                    <h3>Personal Site</h3>
                    <p>In 2023, I finally decided to revamp this site. The previous iteration, built on Wordpress as a media communications project 
                        in college, featured an outdated design and old information, and was needlessly complex. This version of the site is built using GitHub Pages and simple, static HTML and CSS.
                    I took care to preserve some key information from the old site.</p>

                    <h3>Capstone Course</h3>
                    <p>In the spring of 2018, I completed the capstone course for my Computer Science degree. In April, our team demonstrated the game we created over the semester to our friends, fellow students, and the rest of Harding University at the Software and Engineering Showcase. Awards were also distributed to the winning teams in several categories.</p>                    
                    <p>In Hardingâ€™s capstone course, each computer science student is assigned to a team of four or five students. Each team is given a board game and is tasked with developing a video game from it.</p>
                    <p>The team is responsible for all aspects of the project, from the design of the theme to accompany the board game through every detail of implementation. Reports are given along the way to demonstrate progress to the professor and class.</p>
                    <p>I was honored to be the team leader for Team 1 and our game Space Race. Working alongside my teammates was an awesome experience, and I will be ever thankful for their friendship, cooperation, vision, and commitment to the project. Serving as the team leader also allowed the course to count as my Honors Capstone.</p>                    
                    <p>I also served as the AI Lead for the project and, with help especially from one of my teammates, developed an AI for our game that ended up winning in a competition against the AIs of the other six teams.</p>
                    <p>I am really proud of my team and what we were able to accomplish in just a short semester.</p>
