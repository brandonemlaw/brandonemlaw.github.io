            <p>Searcy, AR ( HU16 News) – At a historic building in downtown Searcy, Center on the Square is opening their second show of the season. The stars of their newest show are veterans of the program.</p>
            <p>Nancy Liles has been involved in Center on the Square since the very beginning. “My character is Lucille,” she says, “and she may be my alter ego. She is out there; she is living life. And I am not quite as out there as she is, and so it’s kind of nice to be somebody different.”</p>
            <p>Dot Hatfield moved to Arkansas 20 years ago and went to open auditions. “I have kind of smart mouth,” she says about her character. Her fellow lead actresses agree. “I really like the character that I’m playing. I can feel kind of her character a little bit.”</p>
            <p>Julee Holder has been involved in the program so long she can’t remember how she got started. “My character is just kind of a sweet little lady,” she says. “I like the relationship that all three of the women have together, and we, as women, have a nice relationship with each other as we’re in and out of each others’ lives all the time.”</p>
            <p>The show is about three Jewish widows living in the Big Apple. “I think people will come away thinking about it later,” Holder says. “I think things will pop into their head and they’ll go, ‘They talked about that.'”</p>
            <p>“I think they’ll be surprised,” Liles adds, “that a show called The Cemetery Club is actually about living and how these three women chose to live their lives.”</p>
            <p>Wendy Neil started at Center on the Square 10 years ago by starring in the show Guys and Dolls. She now serves as the Executive Creative Director. She says this show is the perfect mix of comedy and heartwarming drama. “You laugh, but you are also about to cry. It really touches people. It’s very real. It’s how these three women are dealing with grief. … It’s about marriage, it’s about life, it’s about death…. And these actresses are fantastic.”</p>
            <p>Center on the Squares provides a community theatre experience for people of all ages. The stars of the show were proud to say that the 16 year old working the lights laughs even though he’s seen the show several times.</p>
            <p>Center on the Square opens The Cemetery Club on September 14th at 7:30. The show runs through the end of the month. Tickets cost $35 with a meal and $18 without, and discounts are available for seniors, those in the military, and students.</p>
            <p>More information about Center on the Square and how to purchase tickets can be found on <a href="http://www.centeronthesquare.org/">CenterOnTheSquare.org</a>. Auditions for the next major show are open later this month.</p>
