          <p>SEARCY (HU16 News) – Harding University’s homecoming week is here, and the activities begin today. It kicks off Monday night with Midnight Madness.</p>
          <p>“Curfew is extended to 12:30 with no grace period,” Coach Jeff Morgan announced in chapel to applause. “So let’s come out tonight and have a great time.”</p>
          <p>Midnight Madness is a Harding tradition the brings the campus together. Like last year, Bison fans will gather in the Rhodes Reaves Field House to kick of the basketball season.</p>
          <p>“We’ll have a band, cheerleaders, lots of giveaways, a lot of crowd competitions for you to be involved in,” Morgan added.</p>
          <p>After Midnight Madness tonight at 11, students are continuing the fun with I Heart HU Week.</p>
          <p>“CAB is hosting theme days for I Love HU Week,” said Harding SA President Hallie Hite. “There are fun prizes for each day, so if you dress up, tag CAB in your picture  and you might win an awesome prize.”</p>
          <p>The weekend begins full-force on Friday with a variety of events:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>9:30 – Harding Academy Dedication and Ribbon Cutting</li>
            <li>4:00 – Good News Singers</li>
            <li>8:00 – Bison 3K GLOW Run</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Events continue on Saturday, with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>10:45 – Harding Authors Book Signing</li>
            <li>10:45 – Inflatable Games and Petting Zoo</li>
            <li>10:45 – Women for Harding store</li>
            <li>11:00 – Legacy Park Walking Tour</li>
            <li>11:00 – Bells and Beaux</li>
            <li>11:00 – Pied Pipers children’s theatre troup</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Various Harding groups are holding reunions throughout the weekend. Men’s social clubs Knights and Alpha Tau Epsilon will be holding 50th Anniversary reunions and women’s social club Delta Nu will be holding a ten year reunion.</p>
          <p>Additional events include</p>
          <p>The homecoming musical, Big Fish, will be performed Friday and Saturday at 8pm.</p>
          <p>THE HOMECOMING MUSICAL, BIG FISH, WILL BE PERFORMED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AT 8PM.</p>
          <p>“The cast is seriously extraordinary,” says Sydney Sanford, a theatre student involved in the production. “It’s just very different and it’s something you’re going to be really upset if you miss. And there’s a mermaid somewhere in it.”</p>
          <p>“It’s a much smaller cast,” says James Tyler Adams, a member of the ensemble for Big Fish. “It’s still got the same amount of spectacle, but the cast is almost half of what we normally use. So that might shock people if they’ve been paying attention to that. If not, just the amount of quick changes and speed at which the show moves will also really surprise people.”</p>
          <p>And, of course, the reason for it all – the Harding University Homecoming football game. It starts at 11:30 with the Walk of Brothers, then tailgating until the kickoff at 2 at First Security Stadium.</p>
